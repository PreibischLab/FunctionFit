To do:
	
	- Rerun ellipse detection -> ellipse =null
	
	
	- Klim: if ellipsoids are aligned before prediction -> better results?
	- Intron detection status
	- (Learn how to run radial symmetry detection)
	

	
	
Done:
	
- just the output to terminal while the script runs - can you add the filename (from the csv "filename") before the rest of the output of the ellipsoid fitting
	â—‹ and just print which file is currently being processed
- Make BitMasks from Ellipses
- Crop pictures with extra space around embryo
	- Give cropped name
- Delete bad ellipsoid in csv?
- Loaded embryo can be ellipse or ROI
- Jump to next image/null image
